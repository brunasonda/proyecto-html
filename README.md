### 📂 Working space

We will work on an HTML file that will be saved inside a specific folder.

### ℹ️ Detailed directions

We’ll use semantic HTML5 tags to structure the content, paying attention to how the “boxes” or elements are organized, so that another developer can later add CSS styles.
>🚫 Do not add any CSS
